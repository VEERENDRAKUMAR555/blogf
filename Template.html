         How to use VS Code for HTML?
        To create a new HTML template in VSCode, you can follow these steps:
        Open VSCode and create a new file by clicking on the Explorer icon on the left panel, then click New File or press Ctrl + N (Windows) / Cmd + N (Mac).
        Save the new file with the . ...
        Type in the basic HTML structure by typing html and pressing Enter.
        To build a webpage with Visual Studio Code, you will need to create an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file will contain the content of your webpage, the CSS file will be used to style the content, 
        and the JavaScript file will be used to add interactivity to your webpage.
        Visual Studio Code has built-in support for editing style sheets in CSS .css , SCSS .scss and Less
        less . In addition, you can install an extension for greater functionality.
        Formatting options will be available in the Extensions section, including options for built-in formatters. For example, we use the option Brace Style in CSS Language Features > CSS to choose whether CSS opening braces should
        be placed on the same line as rules (collapse) or on their own line.
        Here's the trick: Create a new webpage. Paste your CSS code directly onto the page.Save the page as a ". css" file (e.g., "mystyles. css").
